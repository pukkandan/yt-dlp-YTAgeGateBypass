A [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) extractor [plugin](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#plugins) to bypass YouTube age-gate  

Uses [account proxy](https://youtube-proxy.zerody.one) by [zerodytrash](https://github.com/zerodytrash) to fetch video formats and [a free proxy service](https://www.4everproxy.com) for download (if required)  

Pass `--extractor-args youtube:no-video-proxy` to disable the download proxy service. This may prevent certain videos from downloading  

Note: The account proxy has limited resources. Please do not abuse
